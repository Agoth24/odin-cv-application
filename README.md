# CV Application Project 📋

## Welcome to my first React Project

[See it Live](https://agoth24-cv-generator.netlify.app/)

This week I've started learning react via *The Odin Project*, covering the basics
with an in-depth intro to concepts such as functional components, props,
state, and rendering techniques.

## Skills Targeted:

- Learning to re-wire my brain to think in components instead of HTML pages.
- Getting my hands on these components, writing logic in them and intertwining
logic with structure.
- Managing state amongst parent -> child/sibling components
- Making design decisions about where state lives.
